He is the son of Jin Itadori and grandson of Wasuke Itadori who was living a normal life until he encountered Megumi and ate one of Sukuna's fingers.

Megumi is the step-brother of Tsumiki Fushiguro and as the son of Toji Fushiguro, Megumi is also a descendant of the Zenin Family. Megumi was born outside the clan as Toji's trump card and was eventually found by Satoru Gojo, who mentored him and enrolled him at Jujutsu High as his student.</td>

        <td>According to a legend, during the golden age of jujutsu over 1,000 years ago, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮想かそうの鬼神きじん Kasō no Kijin?), though in truth was a human sorcerer, and other sorcerers gave their all to defeat him. After his death, he became a cursed spirit, and his curse was too strong for his body to be fully destroyed. Henceforth, his remains of 20 indestructible fingers, preserved in grave wax, traversed the ages as cursed objects, ever growing in power.[1] In the present, Sukuna has been incarnated into Yuji Itadori due to the latter eating one of his cursed fingers, which contain his fragmented power.</td>

        <td>Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies. Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. </td>

        </td>
        <td>Nanami is a very wise and reserved kind of man, often appearing so calm and indifferent that he comes off as stoic and aloof. He seems like the kind of person who's too serious about his work, but Nanami just knows how to separate sentimentalism from service. He's blunt and straight to the point in most conversations and doesn't care for impractical optimism or questions left open to interpretation. When it comes to combat ability, Nanami is capable of fighting on par with special grade cursed spirits such as Mahito. While Mahito was still in the infancy of his existence, Nanami was able to keep up in several of the exchanges. With a lack of information on Mahito's ability, Nanami suffered a direct blow to his soul but was still able to survive, something no one Mahito faced before had been able to do. Mahito himself considered Nanami to be exceptionally strong and a worthy opponent, far stronger than the average sorcerer.
